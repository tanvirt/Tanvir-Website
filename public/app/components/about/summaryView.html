            I am a software developer with a passion for technology and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy working in fast-paced, team-oriented environments. I consider myself intelligent, hard-working, conscientious, and dedicated. I have a great fondness for working on projects that help others, showcase artistry, and have a certain "coolness" factor.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a big believer in having strong foundations for writing reliable, maintainable, reusable, and efficient code. I take pride in being able to apply core software concepts and design patterns to projects that involve languages, tools, and environments that are completely new to me. I am a fast learner and take good programming practices very seriously. I always code as if the person who ends up maintaining my code will be a violent psychopath who knows where I live.
